# Revenue Operating Cadence Framework

The difference between scaling to €150M and stalling at €20M isn't forecasting accuracy—it's **operating rhythm**. Your cadence is the machine that turns strategy into deals into board updates. Get it wrong and you're firefighting every week. Get it right and revenue becomes predictable.

## The Core Principle: Data Pyramid

Every decision flows from clean data. Every data input flows from activity. The pyramid collapses if the base is dirty.

```
          ┌─────────────────┐
          │    BOARD        │
          │  (Quarterly)    │
          │  Narrative+KPIs │
          └────────┬────────┘
                   │
          ┌────────▼────────┐
          │  LEADERSHIP     │
          │ (Monthly/QBR)   │
          │ Trends+Decisions│
          └────────┬────────┘
                   │
          ┌────────▼────────┐
          │      TEAM       │
          │   (Weekly)      │
          │Pipeline+Forecast│
          └────────┬────────┘
                   │
          ┌────────▼────────┐
          │   ACTIVITY      │
          │    (Daily)      │
          │ Calls/Deals/Logs│
          └─────────────────┘
```

If activity is garbage → pipeline data lies → forecasts fail → board gets surprises.

## The Meeting Architecture (7 Questions for Every Meeting)

Before you schedule it, answer these:

| Element | Question | Bad Answer | Good Answer |
|---------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | What decision does this produce? | "Check on things" | "Lock forecast by Friday noon" |
| **Frequency** | How often? | "Weekly because that's what we do" | "Weekly for accountability, monthly for trends" |
| **Participants** | Who MUST be here? | "The whole team" | "Sales managers + CRO only (RevOps attends async)" |
| **Inputs** | What prep is required? | People wing it | Pre-built forecast model + deal aging report |
| **Agenda** | How do we spend the time? | Meandering | 15 min data review, 30 min decisions, 5 min actions |
| **Outputs** | What leaves the room? | "We'll figure it out" | Logged forecast, deal actions with owners |
| **Accountability** | Who owns follow-through? | Nobody | Action log with due dates + owner names |

**Rule:** If a meeting doesn't produce decisions or logged actions, send an email instead.

## The Core Ceremonies

### Daily: Sales Pipeline Pulse (15 min, team level)
**Purpose:** Surface blockers. Coordinate same-day wins.

```
Rep 1: "AWS deal stuck on legal review. Need legal in Wed meeting."
Rep 2: "Acme expanded scope—moving to €650k. Closes Friday."
Rep 3: "Nordic Bank went dark for 3 days. Need help re-engaging."
```

**RevOps role:** Not in the room. But your pre-built CRM views should make this data self-serve.

---

### Weekly: Pipeline Review (45 min per team, Sales Manager + team)
**Purpose:** Inspect deal progression. Identify stalled deals. Lock forecast.

**Pre-meeting packet (built by RevOps):**
- Pipeline stage movement report (last 7 days)
- Deal aging by stage (red flag if >14 days without movement)
- Forecast accuracy vs. prior week
- Win/loss summary (reasons why deals close/slip)

**Agenda:**
| Time | Owner | Output |
|------|-------|--------|
| 0-5 min | Sales Manager | Context (priorities this week) |
| 5-35 min | Team | Review deals >7 days old + red-flag risks |
| 35-40 min | Sales Manager | Commit vs. best case for the week |
| 40-45 min | All | Logged actions: who's doing what by when? |

**Key questions to ask:**
- Which deals moved stage? Why?
- Which are stalled? What's the blocker?
- What's our commit number? What's the gap to plan?
- Who's at risk of slipping? What's the recovery action?

**Output:** Updated individual forecasts logged in CRM.

---

### Weekly: Forecast Roll-up (30 min, CRO + Sales Managers + RevOps)
**Purpose:** Aggregate to company view. Identify gaps to plan.

**Participants:**
- CRO (decision owner)
- Sales managers (inputs)
- RevOps (owns the model, flags anomalies)

**Pre-meeting:**
- Consolidated forecast from all teams
- Variance to plan (month/quarter)
- Confidence % by deal stage
- Top 10 at-risk deals

**Agenda:**
| What | Time | Owner |
|------|------|-------|
| Review company forecast vs. target | 10 min | RevOps |
| Identify gap-closing actions | 15 min | CRO + managers |
| Log decisions & owners | 5 min | All |

**Questions:**
- Where do we stand vs. quarterly target?
- What's our gap? What closes it?
- Where's the risk in the commit?

**Output:** Locked company forecast. Gap-closing action log.

---

### Bi-weekly: Funnel Review (60 min, Marketing + Sales + CS + RevOps)
**Purpose:** Diagnose funnel health. Identify stage bottlenecks.

**Pre-meeting data:**
- Conversion rates by stage (vs. historical baseline)
- Lead-to-opportunity velocity
- MQL quality score (if tracked)
- Bottleneck analysis (where do deals slow down?)
- Win rate by segment/region

**Agenda:**
| Section | Time | Owner |
|---------|------|-------|
| MQL quality & lead flow | 15 min | Marketing |
| Lead-to-opp conversion | 10 min | Sales |
| Opportunity velocity & close rates | 15 min | RevOps |
| Retention & expansion | 10 min | CS |
| Cross-functional actions | 10 min | All |

**Questions:**
- Are conversion rates healthy? Where's the drop-off?
- Is MQL quality up or down?
- How fast are deals moving through pipeline?
- What's the correlation between retention and new revenue?

**Output:** Cross-functional action owners. Experiments to try (e.g., "improve lead routing to reduce opp velocity").

---

### Monthly: Business Review (90 min, Leadership + RevOps + Finance)
**Purpose:** Review performance vs. plan. Spot trends. Small steers.

**Participants:**
- CRO / VP Sales
- CMO / VP Marketing
- VP Customer Success
- RevOps
- Finance (if available)

**Pre-meeting deck (8-10 slides max):**
1. Revenue vs. plan (€M, waterfall, growth %)
2. Pipeline health (coverage, velocity, quality)
3. Efficiency metrics (CAC, payback, LTV:CAC)
4. Retention & expansion (NRR, GRR, churn)
5. Go-to-market performance (what's working)
6. Risks & escalations
7. Asks & resource needs

**Rule:** No more than 1 chart per slide. If you need 5 charts to explain something, you don't understand it yet.

**Output:** Documented priorities, resource decisions, escalations.

---

### Quarterly: QBR (Half-day, Leadership team + board prep)
**Purpose:** Assess strategy execution. Major steers. Plan adjustments.

**Participants:**
- CEO / CRO
- All functional leaders
- RevOps (data owner)
- Finance (if applicable)

**Data inputs:**
- Full-year revenue performance (actual, forecast, plan variance)
- Pipeline trends (coverage, velocity, win rate)
- Customer health (NRR, cohort analysis, churn reasons)
- Efficiency trends (CAC, payback, burn multiple)
- Market/competitive shifts
- Team capacity vs. targets

**Agenda:**
```
Morning (2-3 hours)
├─ Revenue health (30 min)
├─ Go-to-market performance (30 min)
├─ Pipeline & forecast confidence (30 min)
├─ Customer & retention (30 min)
├─ What's working / What's not (30 min)
└─ Steers & resource reallocation (30 min)

Afternoon (1 hour)
├─ Board deck dry-run
├─ Key narratives (What do we tell the board?)
└─ Board asks & timeline
```

**Key questions:**
- Are we on track for annual targets? By how much?
- What's working that we should double down on?
- What's broken that we need to fix?
- Where should we invest next? What should we kill?
- What capabilities are we missing?

**Output:** Updated quarterly plan. Board deck draft. Resource allocation decisions.

---

### Quarterly: Board Meeting (2-3 hours)
**Purpose:** Governance, accountability, strategic guidance.

**Board deck structure (8-10 slides):**

```
SLIDE 1: Executive Summary + Asks
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Key narrative in 3 bullets      │
│ If you read nothing else...     │
│ Board decisions needed          │
└─────────────────────────────────┘

SLIDE 2-3: Revenue Performance vs. Plan
├─ ARR, ARR growth %, composition
├─ Waterfall (starting ARR → ending ARR)
└─ Variance explanation (story, not excuses)

SLIDE 4-5: Pipeline & Forecast
├─ Coverage ratio (pipeline / annual target)
├─ Velocity trends (deal cycle time)
├─ Win rate by segment
└─ Confidence in this quarter's forecast

SLIDE 6: Efficiency Metrics
├─ CAC (€)
├─ CAC Payback (months)
├─ LTV:CAC ratio
├─ Burn multiple (spend per € ARR)
├─ Rule of 40 (growth % + operating margin %)
└─ Trends quarter-over-quarter

SLIDE 7: Retention & Expansion
├─ NRR (%), GRR (%)
├─ Cohort churn trends
├─ Top churn reasons + actions
└─ Expansion revenue trends

SLIDE 8: Go-to-Market Update
├─ What's working (segment, product, channel)
├─ What's broken + fix in progress
├─ Competitive landscape shifts
└─ Key experiments running

SLIDE 9: Strategic Initiatives
├─ Status (on track / at risk / complete)
├─ Timeline
├─ Key risks & mitigation
└─ Resource needs

SLIDE 10: Asks & Decisions Needed
├─ Board votes required
├─ Budget requests + ROI expected
└─ Timeline for decisions
```

**Golden rules:**
- Lead with narrative, not data
- Show trends, not snapshots
- Highlight risks and asks upfront
- No more than 3 metrics per slide
- Connect every number to strategy

**RevOps role:** Build the data foundation. Don't own the narrative—that's the CEO/CRO.

## The Data Inputs That Matter

| Ceremony | Must-Have Data | Who Owns? | Cadence |
|----------|---|---|---|
| Daily standup | CRM views, deal status, activity log | Sales teams | Real-time |
| Weekly pipeline | Stage movement, deal aging, forecast accuracy | RevOps | Weekly |
| Weekly forecast roll-up | Consolidated forecast, variance to plan, confidence | RevOps | Weekly |
| Bi-weekly funnel | Conversion rates, velocity, bottlenecks | RevOps + Marketing | Bi-weekly |
| Monthly business review | Revenue, pipeline, efficiency, retention | RevOps + Finance | Monthly |
| QBR | Full business health dashboard | RevOps | Quarterly |
| Board meeting | Executive summary + KPI deck | RevOps (data) + CEO (narrative) | Quarterly |

---

## Anti-patterns (Kill These)

| Anti-pattern | Cost | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Meetings without pre-read** | 15 mins of every meeting wasted reading slides | Require slide pre-delivery 24h before. If people ask questions that were on slide 2, send them back. |
| **Reviews without actions** | Decisions made Monday, forgotten Wednesday | Log every action: owner name, due date, success metric. Review at start of next meeting. |
| **Forecast as negotiation** | "I'll commit to 95% but I think it could be 110%" = forecasts are useless | Make forecast analytical, not emotional. "Best case," "commit," and "at-risk" are data, not negotiation. |
| **Dashboard theater** | 40 metrics shown, 5 matter, board confused | Max 3-5 metrics per meeting. Every number must connect to a decision or action. |
| **Cadence without accountability** | Actions slip. Priorities aren't actually priorities. | Name the owner. Publish the due date. Review status at next meeting. Not done? Escalate. |
| **Activity data not validated** | Everything above the pyramid is garbage | Monthly: audit your CRM. Who's logging activities? Are stage changes real or random? |

## Norton Framework Additions (Source: Kyle Norton, Revenue Leadership Podcast, 2026)

### Closed-Loop Feedback System

The cadence must flow in both directions — information up AND learning down.

**Upward Flow (existing):** Activity → Team Metrics → Leadership Review → Board

**Downward Flow (add this):** Board decisions → Strategy adjustments → Manager coaching priorities → Rep behavior change → Activity patterns

**Decision Authority Architecture:**
Every meeting in the cadence should have a clear decision owner:
- Daily pulse: Rep self-manages, escalates blockers
- Weekly pipeline: Manager decides deal actions, coaches
- Weekly forecast: Director decides resource allocation
- Monthly review: VP decides strategic adjustments
- Quarterly: CRO/Board decides investment and structural changes

**Coaching Integration:**
Coaching doesn't happen separately — it happens DURING reviews. Pipeline review = coaching moment. Forecast review = strategic coaching moment. The cadence IS the coaching system.

### Discipline as AI Prerequisite (Donovan, E61)

The #1 differentiator between top performers and average performers using AI is NOT which tools they use. It's operating discipline.

**Key finding:** Top vs. average performers adopt the same AI use cases in roughly the same order. Same tools, same use cases — the difference is operating discipline.

**Donovan's one-play doctrine:** "If I could only run one play: incredibly disciplined weekly deal reviews."

**CRO screening insight:** Donovan screens CRO candidates for Insight Partners portfolio companies. #1 factor: operating rhythm. He back-channels former teams to find out what it was actually like to work for that person.

**Research backing:** K. Anders Ericsson's work on deliberate practice — feedback-rich environments with tight iteration loops produce mastery faster than anything else. AI amplifies the feedback loop. But you need the loop first.

**Assessment question:** Before any AI investment conversation, ask: "How tight is your operating rhythm?" This should precede "Which AI tool should we buy?"

**Diagnostic implication:** If a client's weekly deal reviews aren't disciplined, no AI tool will fix their forecast accuracy. Fix the cadence before investing in AI.

### The Predictability Playbook (Canaani, E64)

A starting template for leaders who want to build predictable revenue operations.

**The prerequisites (every function must know):**
1. Directors and VPs must build predictable models with conversion rates, capacity constraints, and cost per output
2. Growth owns top-of-funnel math
3. RevOps owns instrumentation
4. Sales knows exactly: how many meetings they're getting this quarter + what they need to convert

**Datarails proof point:**
- Projected new ARR within 5% margin of error, three out of four quarters
- Sales cycle: 30-45 days (known and modelled)
- Every stage conversion rate tracked and used for planning

**The principle:** Build the system first, staff it second, let the math do the recruiting for you.

**Cadence integration:** The predictability playbook is what the weekly forecast and monthly business review SHOULD produce. If your cadence doesn't generate these numbers reliably, the cadence is broken — not the forecast methodology.

### Operating Rhythm Assessment (new diagnostic tool)

Add this to the start of any cadence design engagement:

| Dimension | Score 1 (Weak) | Score 3 (Adequate) | Score 5 (Strong) |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Deal review frequency** | Ad-hoc or monthly | Weekly but inconsistent | Weekly, never missed, structured |
| **Pre-meeting data** | None — people wing it | Some data pulled manually | Automated packet delivered 24h before |
| **Decision logging** | No actions recorded | Actions noted but not tracked | Actions logged, owners named, reviewed next meeting |
| **Forecast accuracy** | ±25%+ | ±15-20% | ±5-10% |
| **Cross-functional sync** | Marketing/Sales don't talk | Monthly alignment meeting | Bi-weekly funnel review with shared metrics |
| **Coaching integration** | Coaching separate from reviews | Some coaching in reviews | Pipeline review IS the coaching system |

**Scoring:** 24-30 = ready for AI investment. 15-23 = fix cadence first. <15 = operating cadence rebuild before anything else.


## How to Use This Skill

**Week 1:** Map your current meetings. Which are producing decisions? Which are theater?

**Week 2:** Design your ideal cadence using the 7-question framework above. What meetings do you NEED?

**Week 3:** Build your data inputs. Can RevOps deliver what each meeting requires?

**Week 4:** Run the first iteration. Imperfect data executed well beats perfect data never delivered.

**Ongoing:** Every quarter, audit your cadence. Is every meeting producing value? Is every metric driving action?

**For the CRO:** Your agenda for next week is to lock your forecast cadence. That one meeting ripples through everything else.

**For RevOps:** Start with one meeting (probably weekly forecast). Get that data tight. Then layer in the others.

### The 10-Minute Board Defence

A structured alternative to the 40-slide board deck. Five questions, one page, ten minutes.

**The 5 Questions:**
1. **Are we on track?** — Current quarter vs plan. Actual pipeline value, weighted pipeline, commit vs target. One number, one trend line. No spin.
2. **Why?** — Win rate by segment and motion. What's converting, what isn't. If win rate dropped, name top 3 reasons from loss analysis.
3. **What changed?** — Actions taken this quarter based on data. Not plans. Experiment results, process changes, measured impact.
4. **What do we need?** — Resource or investment asks with projected ROI. Every ask tied to a specific conversion gap or capacity constraint.
5. **What's the risk?** — Top 3 risks to hitting plan. Concentration risk, pipeline gap timing, churn signals. Be specific.

**Data prerequisites:**
- Pipeline health: weighted pipeline by stage, coverage ratio by segment, stage velocity trends
- Conversion engine: win rate by motion, loss reasons (top 3), cycle time changes
- Leading indicators: new pipeline created this month, expansion signals from CS, churn risk accounts

**Anti-pattern:** 40-slide deck → 2 hours to prepare → board skips to bad news → CRO defensive → ends with "send us the data" → trust erodes.

**The framework:** 10-minute defence → 30 minutes to prepare → board gets answers immediately → CRO leads the conversation → ends with clear decisions → trust compounds.

## What good looks like

Great output designs each ceremony against the 7-question framework — every meeting names its decision, required participants, pre-read delivered 24 hours ahead, and logged actions with owners and due dates — layered on the data pyramid so daily activity data feeds weekly forecasts, monthly reviews, and a narrative-led 8-10 slide board deck (or the 10-minute five-question board defence). The Operating Rhythm Assessment is scored honestly before layering anything new, and coaching happens inside the reviews, not beside them.

Mediocre output is a calendar of status meetings: no pre-reads, forecasts negotiated instead of analysed, 40-metric dashboard theater, actions decided Monday and forgotten Wednesday, and a 40-slide board deck that leads with data instead of narrative. The cadence exists on paper but produces no decisions, so the board keeps getting surprised.
