## Salesforce vs HubSpot: Architectural Differences

When advising clients on Salesforce (especially those familiar with HubSpot), ground the conversation in these structural differences:

| Aspect | Salesforce | HubSpot |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Data model** | Account-centric (Account → Contact → Opportunity) | Person-centric (Contact-first, company association) |
| **Leads** | Separate object; conversion creates Account + Contact + Opportunity | Contact lifecycle stages (no separate Lead object required) |
| **Custom objects** | Full RDBMS-style (lookups, master-detail, junction objects, roll-ups) | Simpler custom objects; fewer relational capabilities |
| **Automation** | Salesforce Flow (record-triggered, scheduled, platform events, screen) | Workflows (simpler, fewer branching options) |
| **Forecasting** | Collaborative forecasting with multi-level rollup, manager overrides, splits | Basic forecasting in Sales Hub Enterprise |
| **Reporting** | Report builder + dashboards + CRM Analytics (Tableau CRM) | Reports + dashboards; less depth for complex analysis |
| **Territory mgmt** | Enterprise Territory Management with hierarchies, multi-assignment | Basic assignment rules only |
| **Enrichment** | No native enrichment; requires third-party (ZoomInfo, Apollo, Clearbit) | Native enrichment + Clearbit (HubSpot-owned) |
| **Scoring** | Einstein AI (paid) or custom Flow-based | Property-based scoring + predictive (paid) |
| **Splits** | Native opportunity splits for team selling | Not native; workaround with custom objects |
| **Pricing** | Per-user licensing; feature tiers (Essentials → Enterprise → Unlimited) | Tiered hubs; more included at each level |

### When Salesforce Is the Right Choice
- Complex selling motions (team selling, splits, multi-pipeline)
- Enterprise accounts with deep hierarchies
- Advanced territory management needs
- Heavy customisation requirements
- Existing Salesforce investment/ecosystem

### When HubSpot Is the Right Choice
- Marketing-heavy orgs wanting CRM + marketing automation in one platform
- Simpler sales motions; smaller teams
- Speed-to-value priority (faster setup)
- Budget-conscious orgs wanting all-in-one

## Core Implementation Checklist

When setting up or auditing Salesforce for RevOps, work through these areas in order:

### 1. Object Model Design
**Read**: `references/sfdc-object-model.md`

Key decisions:
- Lead-first vs Contact/Account-first workflow (most consequential choice)
- Record Type strategy (New Business vs Renewal vs Expansion opportunities)
- Custom objects needed (Subscription, Handoff Record, Health Score)
- Relationship types (lookup vs master-detail, when to use junction objects)
- Field governance (naming conventions, required fields, field limits)

### 2. Automation Architecture
**Read**: `references/sfdc-automation-flows.md`

Key decisions:
- Flow consolidation strategy (max 3 flows per object: before-save, after-save, before-delete)
- Flow naming convention: `[Object]_[Trigger]_[Purpose]_v[Version]`
- Feature flags via Custom Metadata Types (enable/disable logic without redeployment)
- Flow vs Apex boundary (Flow-first; Apex for >10K records, complex error handling, sub-second integrations)
- Migration plan from deprecated Process Builders and Workflow Rules

### 3. Opportunity Pipeline
**Read**: `references/sfdc-pipeline-forecasting.md`

Key decisions:
- Stage model (5-8 stages with verifiable exit criteria)
- Forecast category mapping (Pipeline, Best Case, Commit, Closed, Omitted)
- Validation rules (no stage skipping, amount required at Proposal, loss reason required)
- Multi-pipeline via Record Types (if different motions exist)
- Opportunity Splits configuration (if team selling)

### 4. Forecasting Setup
**Read**: `references/sfdc-pipeline-forecasting.md`

Key decisions:
- Forecast type (Opportunity Amount, Product, Split, Product Family)
- Forecast hierarchy aligned to role hierarchy
- Manager override permissions
- Period (monthly vs quarterly)
- Forecast snapshot tracking for accuracy measurement

### 5. Reporting & Dashboards

Essential dashboard framework by audience:

**Executive** (CRO/VP — weekly):
- Pipeline by forecast category
- Pipeline coverage ratio (pipeline ÷ remaining target)
- Win rate trend (rolling 3 months)
- Forecast vs actual (current + prior 2 periods)
- Top 10 deals with stage and next step

**Manager** (front-line — daily):
- Team pipeline by rep and stage
- Deals advancing vs stalling this week
- Stale deals (no activity in configurable threshold)
- Speed-to-lead SLA compliance
- Forecast accuracy by rep

**RevOps Operational** (RevOps team — weekly):
- Data quality scores (field completion %)
- Stage conversion rates (funnel)
- Pipeline velocity (days per stage)
- Loss reason distribution
- Pipeline created vs target

### 6. Integrations

Common integration patterns:

| Integration | Direction | System of Record |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| HubSpot ↔ Salesforce | Bi-directional (lifecycle and campaign data) | Salesforce for revenue; HubSpot for marketing |
| Enrichment (ZoomInfo, Apollo) | Inbound to Salesforce | Enrichment provider |
| Slack | Outbound from Salesforce | Salesforce (notifications only) |
| CPQ | Bi-directional | Salesforce (pricing/quoting) |
| CS Platform (Gainsight, Vitally) | Bi-directional | Depends on CS maturity |

---

## Common Salesforce Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Symptom | Fix |
|-------------|---------|-----|
| Too many custom fields | >500 fields on Account/Opportunity | Audit and deprecate unused fields quarterly |
| No field naming convention | Fields named inconsistently (MQL_Date vs Date_MQL vs mql_dt) | Adopt `[Category]_[Name]__c` standard |
| Mixed automation | Flows AND Apex triggers on same object | Pick one entry point per object |
| No validation rules | Reps skip stages, leave Amount blank | Layer validation (field-level → record-level → Flow) |
| Stale Process Builders | Legacy automation still firing (deprecated Dec 2025) | Migrate to Flow; deactivate old PBs |
| Manual territory assignment | Reps assigned accounts by spreadsheet | Implement ETM or Flow-based territory logic |
| No forecast snapshots | Can't measure forecast accuracy | Build Forecast_Snapshot__c custom object |
| Over-customised page layouts | 50+ fields on one layout | Role-based layouts with progressive disclosure |

## What good looks like

Great output works through the implementation checklist in order — object model first (Lead-first vs Contact-first decided by inbound volume), then Flow architecture (max 3 record-triggered flows per object, named [Object]_[Trigger]_[Purpose]_v[Version]), then a 5-8 stage opportunity model with verifiable exit criteria and forecast-category mapping, and finishes with role-specific dashboards and a Forecast_Snapshot__c object so accuracy can actually be measured. It names concrete fields ([Category]_[Name]__c), validation rules, and migration steps off deprecated Process Builders.

Mediocre output lists Salesforce features without decisions: no stance on Lead vs Contact workflow, stages defined by rep confidence instead of buyer milestones, automation scattered across mixed Flows and Apex triggers, and no snapshot mechanism — reproducing the exact anti-patterns the skill's own table warns against.
