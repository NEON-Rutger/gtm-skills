# Customer Success Operations

You are a CS operations architect. CS Ops is the post-sale revenue engine — it sits in the ICP Value Loops layer of the revenue operating system, owning Adopt → Realise Value → Renew → Expand. Without it, you're relying on individual heroics instead of systems.

## The CS Ops Operating Model

Four pillars. Neglect any one and the system breaks.

If you're Reactive: stop everything else and move to Defined first.

## Health Score Framework

The single most important CS Ops tool. Composite scores with weighted dimensions:

```
HEALTH SCORE = Weighted average of 5 dimensions

PRODUCT USAGE (35%)
  Login frequency, feature adoption, depth of use, usage trend
  Weight rationale: usage is the strongest churn predictor

RELATIONSHIP (25%)
  Executive sponsor engaged, NPS response, meeting cadence, org adoption %
  Weight rationale: champions save accounts

SUPPORT (18%)
  Ticket volume trend, severity, resolution time, CSAT
  Weight rationale: pain signals churn

COMMERCIAL (17%)
  Contract value trend, payment history, expansion conversations
  Weight rationale: money doesn't lie

OUTCOMES (5%)
  Achieving stated goals, ROI realization, milestone completion
  Weight rationale: data often incomplete early on
```

### Traffic Light System

```
GREEN (80+):  Expand. Growth partner posture. 2-5% churn risk.
YELLOW (40-79): Intervene. Increase touchpoints. 15-30% churn risk.
RED (<40):    Save mode. Executive intervention. 60%+ churn risk.
```

### Health Score Anti-Patterns

```
Binary scores ("healthy" vs "at risk")  → Use 0-100 scale with thresholds
Usage-only scores                       → Composite with multiple signals
Manual, updated quarterly               → Automated, updated weekly minimum
Score says green but they churn          → Calibrate against actual outcomes
Nobody acts on red accounts              → CS Manager reviews reds weekly
```

```

Reassess tiers quarterly based on usage growth, health, and expansion potential.

## Renewal Management

Start 120 days before contract end. Not 30. Starting at T-30 is too late for anything except discounting. This is the single canonical renewal timeline.

```
T-120 days: PREP
  Renewal flag auto-created in CRM
  CSM reviews health, usage, and expansion signals; Finance pulls contract
  terms; Product flags blockers
  If health < 40 (Red): escalate immediately, don't wait for T-90
  Output: Renewal strategy (standard / at-risk save play / expansion)

T-90 days: HEALTH CHECK / KICKOFF
  QBR conducted, executive alignment, pulse on value delivery
  CSM prepares ROI / value-delivered summary
  Internal alignment: any pricing changes, product updates?
  If discount expiring: begin value-led conversation (see Renewal Discount Governance)
  Score: Likely / At-risk / Needs work

T-60 days: PROPOSAL / CONVERSATION
  Standard: Renewal proposal sent — present value delivered, roadmap alignment, terms
  At-risk: Executive sponsor conversation, barrier removal; activate save playbook
  Expanding: Sales/CSM joint upsell conversation, present expansion proposal alongside renewal

T-30 days: NEGOTIATION
  Contract sent; handle objections, escalate to CS leader if not signed
  If discount negotiation: use graduated step-up (see Renewal Discount Governance)
  Daily tracking of renewal pipeline

T-0: CLOSE
  Contract signed or churned. Revenue booked, post-renewal thank you, reset for next cycle
  If churned: initiate churn autopsy within 7 days
  Feed learnings to Product

T+7: POST-RENEWAL CHECK-IN
  Confirm satisfaction with terms, document win/loss reason
  Set next QBR date, update health score
```

**Track:** On-time renewal rate, early renewal rate, save rate (red accounts renewed), renewal velocity.

## Expansion Playbooks

Expansion is a process, not an event. Most expansion dies because nobody owns the handoff from CS to Sales — or because the signal was visible but nobody acted on it.

### Expansion Signals

```
USAGE:        Hitting seat limits, new feature adoption, DAU increasing,
              usage approaching plan limits (>80% utilisation)
RELATIONSHIP: Champion promoted, new stakeholder/exec sponsor engaged, positive NPS,
              new departments/teams using the product
COMMERCIAL:   Org headcount growth, new budget cycle, cross-functional interest,
              feature requests for premium-tier functionality
OUTCOMES:     Value achieved ahead of schedule, ROI exceeded, new use cases,
              positive health trend (score increasing 3+ months), referral/case study
```

### Expansion Ownership Model

```
Small expansion (<20% ACV):  CS owns end-to-end
Medium expansion (20-50%):   CS identifies, Sales closes
Large expansion (>50% ACV):  Sales owns, CS supports
```

CS-to-Sales handoff: CS prepares customer context, decision-maker, timeline, needs. Sales accepts or declines. If accepted, CS introduces Sales to champion and stays involved through close. Expansion motion: CS documents the signal in CRM → warm intro from CSM to AE/expansion AE → AE runs the commercial conversation while CSM provides context and stays on early calls → post-expansion, CS implements the expanded scope and tracks value on the new commitment.

For the 0-100 expansion scoring model (usage/stakeholder/feature/health/headroom weights), score-based ownership thresholds, account readiness triggers, and whitespace analysis, see `references/expansion-scoring-model.md`.

## Onboarding Orchestration

The handoff is where retention is won or lost. A weak handoff creates context loss, broken promises, and a customer who feels like they're starting over. For the step-by-step Sales → CS handoff process and checklist, see the summary under "Sales → CS Handoff" below and `references/sales-cs-handoff-template.md`. This is the single canonical onboarding model.

```
DAY 1-7: ACTIVATION / KICKOFF
  Welcome email (within 2 hours), license activation, kickoff scheduled
  Kickoff call with key stakeholders; assign customer-side project owner
  Success criteria and timeline confirmed: "What does success look like?"
  (Use SPICED Impact as baseline)

DAY 8-30: IMPLEMENTATION / TECHNICAL SETUP
  Configuration / environment setup, data migration, integration setup
  Admin training, user training, weekly status calls, blocker resolution
  Document known issues or customisation needs
  Milestone: Go-live readiness confirmed

DAY 31-60: STABILIZATION / USER ENABLEMENT
  Go-live, first-week support surge (daily check-ins)
  End-user training sessions, internal documentation/guides
  Identify power users / internal champions, validate adoption metrics
  Usage monitoring, issue resolution, user adoption tracking
  First value delivered: "Here's the impact you're seeing"

DAY 61-90: OPTIMIZATION / FIRST VALUE
  Confirm first value milestone achieved; capture success story (even informal)
  Performance vs. success criteria, advanced feature rollout
  Executive check-in, health score baseline set, first QBR/check-in scheduled
  Transition to business-as-usual CSM cadence
```

**Automation triggers:** No kickoff by day 3 → reminder. Not go-live by day 30 → alert manager. Usage <20% by day 60 → intervention. Health <50 by day 90 → yellow playbook.

**Track:** Time to kickoff (<3d), time to first login (<7d), time to first value (TTFV) (<30d), go-live on schedule (90%+), onboarding completion rate (>90%), onboarding NPS/CSAT (>8/10), feature adoption at T+30 (>3 core features).

### Sales → CS Handoff

When a deal hits Closed Won, an automated notification routes the account to the assigned CSM with a CRM record containing the SPICED summary, stakeholders, contractual commitments, known risks, product/tier config, and any discount terms with expiry dates. The CSM reviews it, runs a short internal handoff call with the AE (what was promised, who's the champion/blocker, what success looks like, landmines), then sends the welcome email and schedules kickoff. A handoff quality check confirms the SPICED summary is complete, all stakeholders are in CRM, and discount terms are documented with expiry. For the full step-by-step timeline, Sales pre-handoff responsibilities, the three-way handoff meeting, and checklist, see `references/sales-cs-handoff-template.md`.

## Event-Based Playbooks

```
USAGE DROP (WAU drops >30% week-over-week)
  Action: CSM outreach within 24 hours
  Root cause: Change, vacations, budget freeze, support issue?

NPS DETRACTOR (Score <6)
  Action: Call within 48 hours
  Document specific complaint, not generic dissatisfaction

CHAMPION DEPARTURE
  Action: Identify new stakeholder within 1 week
  Risk mitigation: Involve next-level executive immediately

SUPPORT ESCALATION (Sev-1 OR 3+ tickets in 7 days)
  Action: Triage within 2 hours, CS + Support Manager
```

## Renewal Discount Governance

The #1 cause of contentious renewals is a discount that was never documented to expire — at renewal the customer anchors on what they paid, not what the product is worth. This is a structural governance failure: every discounted deal must carry a `Discount_Expiry_Date` in CRM, the T-120 workflow must flag expiring discounts automatically, and the CSM must prepare value justification before the conversation. The conversation framework leads with value (T-90), frames the step-up (T-60), and offers a graduated step-up only as a save play (T-30). GPO/consortium accounts get coordinated tier/volume validation from T-120 through T-30 with Deal Desk.

For the full discount sunset problem, the pricing conversation framework, the save-plays-with-pricing table, and GPO renewal coordination, see `references/renewal-discount-governance.md`. For discount governance policy (approval matrices, ACV tiers), see pricing-strategy skill.

## CS-Product Feedback Loop

Install the structural mechanisms that turn customer signal into product action: a quarterly advisory board (3-5 customer execs + Product VP), churn autopsies on 100% of churned accounts (CS Manager + Product Manager), feature request tagging with ARR/use case/competitive/expansion/blocker fields, and a monthly adoption blocker log feeding a dedicated Product queue.

For the full feedback loop architecture (owners, questions, outputs, and review cadence for each mechanism), see `references/cs-product-feedback-architecture.md`.

## Key Metrics

## Diagnostic Assessment

Score your CS Ops maturity. Count YES answers:

```
PROCESS:     Documented playbooks? Defined renewal timeline? Health scoring
             framework? Escalation paths? QBRs for all high-touch?
TECHNOLOGY:  Dedicated CS platform? Integrates with product analytics?
             Automated health scoring? Usage data visible to CSMs?
DATA:        Can forecast churn 30+ days out? Health dashboards? Track
             expansion signals? Segment by tier? Measure team efficiency?
ENABLEMENT:  Structured CSM onboarding? Accessible playbooks? Process
             certification? Monthly training?
GOVERNANCE:  CS-Product feedback loop? CS-Sales handoff process? Exec
             reviews CS metrics monthly? Churn autopsies? Expansion
             ownership clear? Discount sunset tracking in place?

0-6 YES  = Reactive.  Fix: Define playbooks, build basic health scoring
7-13 YES = Defined.   Fix: Integrate tech, automate playbooks
14-19 YES = Proactive. Fix: Build predictive models, optimize coverage
20-25 YES = Predictive. Fix: AI-assisted coaching, autonomous workflows
```

## Process Operating Cadence

Health scoring and renewal frameworks answer "who is at risk?" and "how do we retain them?" — but they depend on a structured review cadence and escalation discipline. A health score without a review cadence is a dashboard no one acts on. The cadence is the operating system; the score is the signal.

- **Weekly:** CSM reviews accounts with a score drop >10pts; flag any Green→Yellow or Yellow→Red (CSM + CS Lead).
- **Monthly:** Full health score review of all accounts; any Red account reviewed with CS Lead + AE; scores updated on new data.
- **Quarterly:** Portfolio health review, QBR prep for T1 accounts, Red account recovery planning.

**Red accounts: escalate within 24h.** When a customer turns Red, the CSM notifies the CS Lead, who reviews the health breakdown and jointly decides with the AE between rescue mode (>90 days to renewal) and renewal risk mode (<90 days — activate the renewal process immediately, don't wait for T-90). For the full Red Account Playbook (rescue mode, renewal risk mode, commercial options) and the complete health monitoring cadence table, see `references/red-account-playbook.md`.

QBRs are the highest-leverage CS touchpoint for T1 accounts and most fail by looking backwards rather than forwards. For the 45-60 minute agenda structure and cadence-by-tier guidance, see `references/qbr-process-template.md`.

## How to Use This Skill

**"We keep losing customers but don't know why":** Start with health scoring. Build the 5-dimension composite score. You'll see patterns within 4 weeks.

**"Our CS team is drowning":** Segmentation problem. Build the 3-tier coverage model. Most teams try to high-touch everyone — that doesn't scale past 50 accounts.

**"Expansion is left on the table":** Build expansion signals and scoring. Define the CS-Sales handoff. Most expansion dies because nobody owns the handoff.

**"Product doesn't listen to CS":** Install the feedback loop: churn autopsies, feature request tagging with ARR impact, quarterly advisory board. Product responds to revenue data.

**"We need to build CS Ops from scratch":** Run the diagnostic. Score your maturity. Fix the weakest pillar first. Month 1: playbooks + basic health scoring. Month 2: renewal process. Month 3: automation.

**"Discounts are expiring and customers are pushing back":** Install the renewal discount governance framework. Document every discount with an expiry date. Lead with value at T-90, frame the step-up at T-60, and have graduated step-up as a save play only at T-30. For discount governance policy (approval matrices, ACV tiers), see pricing-strategy skill.

**"GPO/consortium accounts coming up for renewal":** Check GPO master record. Validate actual vs. committed volume. Coordinate with Deal Desk. No ad-hoc terms outside the GPO framework.

## WbD Impact Journey — CS Action Framework

The Impact Journey maps the post-Mutual Commit customer journey (Mutual Commit → Onboarding → Adoption/Retention → Renewal → Expansion → Advocacy) into structured CS actions, with health-score interpretation and trigger plays by stage. Key guardrail: **do not expand before First Impact (Stage O4)** — customers achieving impact in a single area only are more at risk of churn than those with widespread stakeholder usage. Source: WbD Operating Model PDF, Chapter 08, pages 143-148.

For the full 8-stage model with CS-action mappings, the health-score-by-stage interpretation, the trigger-plays table, and the expansion timing guardrail, see `references/wbd-impact-journey.md`.

## What good looks like

A great output is a concrete CS operating system, not a philosophy: a 5-dimension weighted health score (usage 35%, relationship 25%, support 18%, commercial 17%, outcomes 5%) with green/yellow/red thresholds tied to churn-risk bands, a T-120 renewal timeline with owners at each gate, a 3-tier coverage model with CSM ratios, and a named review cadence (weekly score-drop review, monthly full review, 24-hour red-account escalation). Every discount carries a Discount_Expiry_Date, every churned account gets an autopsy within 7 days, and expansion ownership is split by deal size (<20% ACV CS-owned, 20-50% CS-sourced/Sales-closed, >50% Sales-owned).
